## Flexbox vs CSS grid
This branch uses **flexbox** to layout the hexagons. Another version using **CSS grid layout** is availbale on the [css-grid branch](https://github.com/web-tiki/responsive-grid-of-hexagons/tree/css-grid).  
CSS grid has lower browser support than flexbox (see [canIuse](https://github.com/RumesahKhalid/Cofee-Shop.git)) but makes the hexagon spacing easier.
